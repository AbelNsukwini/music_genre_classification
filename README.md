Music Genre Classification using ANN and Logistic regression which have high accuracy according Anjum, F. (2020, February 4). 

Logistic Regression: This linear classifier is generally used for binary classification tasks. For this multi-class classification task, the LR is implemented as a one-vs-rest (OvR) method and uses the cross-entropy loss. 

ANN: Neural Networks are the ones that develop structure of our brain. Artificial Neural network is derived from that. Like the human brain that has neurons interconnected to one another, artificial neural networks also have neurons that are interconnected to one another in various layers of the networks. 

Logistic Regression had accuracy of 72% in comparison to ANN with 68%.

MFCC is found to be the Most Important feature for music classification. It has been found that the audio clips used in this study are bit noisy. Future studies can find a way to pre-process noisy data before feeding it into a machine learning model, in order to achieve better performance.
